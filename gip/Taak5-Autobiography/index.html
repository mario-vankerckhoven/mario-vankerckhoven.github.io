<h3 id="autobiography-the-start-of-an-it-revolutionary:344c64788bb5fb907d7294b8bb012b72">Autobiography : The start of an IT revolutionary!</h3>

<p><br>
My name is Mario Van Kerckhoven, some people refer to me as : “ the spiritmaster of Aftermath”, since im the only spiritmaster in the clan Aftermath . I am 16 years old and live in Zandhoven, Belgium. I am still going to the school which is called ‘Immacullata’. It is situated in Oostmalle.</p>

<p><br>
My first expierence with IT obviously was gaming, I think i was 5 or 6 years old when my parents bought me a playstation 2, which was awesome back in the days. When i started to buy my first games, I mean my parents, i tought the characters looked a lot like real people and i tried things in real life that i saw in one of the games i had been playing. I also played on the PC since some of my friends told me to visit websites like Speeleiland.be and funnygames.be .</p>

<p><br>
At the moment IT means for me going to school and follow lessons like software and system management. That also causes that when I am at home, I am sometimes doing IT related things like changing the name of the router. Each week im on the computer for an average of 4-6 hours a day, school included. My IT-related achievements at the moment are: finding a job ( Sita helpdesk support Beerse), I am the number 1 gamer on a minecraft server and I passed 1 year of IT-management on Immacullata. The fascinating part of the IT-related stuff is that u are always puzzling to change nothing in something. As u are following IT-related website/pages on the internet u can clearly see how the  world in changing because of IT-related things like the internet and games. I wouldn’t see myself in an expert yet, but each day i learn more and without noticing I am sure i will become an expert.</p>

<p><br>
When I look to the future I see myself working as a guy from the IT department and maybe a website builder as secondary occupation to make some more money. This could become my major activity as I notice a lot of enterprises ask for a website. At the moment i am already testing if that is somehow possible by a task for school. We have to make a business plan for business management. So i deceided to make it about making websites for people.
one of my aspirations is to one day make some sort of social network that is even better then Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p><br>
I personally think my PC and I are connected because all important data I have is on my computer or in the cloud so I can acces it from my smartphone. IT has quiet an important impact on my life and as I am following IT management I think that impact can only grow bigger and bigger.</p>
